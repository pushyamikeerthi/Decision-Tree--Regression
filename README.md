# Decision-Tree--Regression
used Decision Trees to try and predict gas consumption
The dataset petrol_consumption.csvPreview the document file is taken from FSU dataset repository (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/x16.txt (Links to an external site.)).

For this dataset, used Decision Trees to try and predict gas consumption (in millions of gallons) in 48 US states based upon gas tax (in cents), per capita income (dollars), paved highways (in miles) and the proportion of the population with a driver license.

Used Decision Trees to build a regressor for the give data. Used Grid Search to find the optimal value for the hyperparameters, and evaluate model on the appropriate metrics.
